// What the studio relies on, whatever skill or command wrote the review.
//
// A review command is free to write its report however it likes. This module
// turns that report into one normalized "shape", with a fixed vocabulary:
//
//   { version: 1, source, verdict, summary, findings, warnings }
//
// - verdict:  'APPROVE' | 'REQUEST_CHANGES' | 'OTHER' | null
// - findings: [{ id, severity, title, path, line, body, comment }]
//             severity is 'critical' | 'important' | 'suggestion' | 'info'
//             comment is the text ready to post on the MR, or null
// - source:   where the shape came from, in order of preference:
//               'json'      the command wrote .marginalia-findings.json
//               'markdown'  read from the report's sections and blockquotes
//               'none'      nothing could be read; the studio says so
// - warnings: what the studio should tell the person (never silent degradation)
//
// The shape is written next to the report (<slug>.findings.json) and is what
// the studio lists, counts and posts from. The readers behind it live in
// findings-json.mjs (the structured file) and findings-markdown.mjs (the report).
